The Induction Smelter can only handle one recipe at a time, so it should not get inputs from multiple recipes sent to it at once, as it might get stuck if you do that. That’s there's the option to process the recipes in series: it will only process one recipe at a time until that recipe is done, after which it will move on to the next recipe.
