# Changelog

## [1.0.0] - 2024-XX-XX

### Changes
- implemented pamphlets for books that have only 1 category
- added a new page type for [Pedestal Crafting](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/pedestal-crafting) but should also be useable for stuff like [Extended Crafting](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/extended-crafting-nomifactory-edition)
- added my own version for most of the default pages
  - these are much more modular and space efficient
  - they allow more customization and don't simply break if a field is missing
  - furthermore they provide additional debug information
  - these advanced versions of the pages can be accessed by appending a `+` to the page name (e.g. `text+`)
